# CryptographyProject
This project uses RSA encryption, an AES key, and message authentication code to deliver a message in the form of a text file from a sender to a receiver. It has the ability to generate a set of RSA public and private key pairs of size 1024 bits and encrypts a message from the sender along with an AES key, and generates a MAC. The program assembles all the encrypted parts into a file called Transmitted_Data to be sent to the receiver. Once the receiver gets the Transmitted_Data, the program is able to extract the message, AES key, and MAC and decrypt the AES key which decrypts the message. The receiver then is able to view the sender's message.
